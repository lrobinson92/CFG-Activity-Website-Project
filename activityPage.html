            <ul>What is it? 
                <li>It’s THE best thing you can do in (and on) the sea. 
                    <li>It’s a unique opportunity to go to rarely visited corners of the coast with an expert guide.</li> 
                    <li>It’s an adaptable activity that can be pretty adventurous or really quite mellow (that’s mostly up to you).</li>

                    <li>Coasteering is our speciality, our favourite activity and between us we have thousands of coasteers under our belts. We still want more! </li>
            
                        <li>Our coasteering routes are amazing – we really think they’re some of the best in the world. They’re full of jumps (optional, but EPIC!), swim-throughs, spectacular caves, surfy play spots and hidden gems discovered during decades of exploration by our guides.</li>
                        <li>You’ll see sponges, seaweeds, spider crabs and more. It’s not uncommon for us to be visited by a curious seal.</li>
            
                            <li>Coasteering is our Original Activity and our guides are exceptionally experienced and trained to the highest levels. You’ll find no better cliff-ninjas/seaweed-geeks/ crab-wranglers/maestros of fun to keep you safe during this fantastic adventure.</li>
            
                                <li>Minimum age: 8 years old</li>
